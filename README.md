# MongoDB Fitness Tracker
Fitness tracker built using NodeJS Express, Mongoose, and MongoDB

## Approach
Probably the most important step, I needed to figure out what I needed to do to start this app. I broke down my objective into a few key steps:
1. Set up a server with a connection to a MongoDB database
2. Define MongoDB schemas using Mongoose which will interact with the database
3. Get user input about whether they want to create a new workout, or continue an existing one
4. After choosing a workout, allow users to add new exercises to the workout
5. Save the workout and the exercises to the database
